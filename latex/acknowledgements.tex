I am fortunate enough to have colleagues in academia who have been generous and helped me with technical matters and working through methodology conceptually, these are: Stephen Mann, Angela Chira, Frederic Blum, Siva Kalyan, Benedict King, Michael Dunn, Outi Vesakoski, Luke Maurits, Damiàn Blasi, Tiago Tresoldi, Sam Passmore, Russell Dinnage, Simon Greenhill, Hannah Haynie, Oliver Sheehan, Russell Gray, Matthew Spike, and Richard McElreath. I am indebted to the Oceanic language specialists Mary Walworth, Ray Harlow, Alexander François, Paul Geraghty and Andrew Pawley for advice regarding identifying languages and dialects. Geoffrey Clark and Matthew Spriggs provided very helpful guidance on archaeological literature of Oceania. I am also grateful to the two anonymous reviewers and staff of the Journal of Language Evolution for their valuable feedback and to my PhD thesis supervisors Andrew Pawley, Nicholas Evans, Mark Ellison, Simon Greenhill and the external anonymous reviewers of the dissertation who all provided valuable commentary on earlier versions of this work. In particular, I am grateful to Simon Greenhill for showing me Marck's work on overnight sailing distances which inspired me to think more deeply about island groups and  Ursin Maurus Beeli, Michael Zurmühle and Peter Ranacher who collaborated with me on simulations of sailing cost distances in the pacific. Any mistakes and misconceptions that remain are my own.
