\section{Introduction}
\doublespacing

The number of languages in the world is not equally distributed over area and population. In the modern country of Papua New Guinea, there are 835 languages over a population of 9.7 million people \citep{UN_pop, glottolog3}. However, in South Korea, there are only two indigenous spoken languages in a population of 52 million people. How can this be?

Understanding the mechanics of language change and diversification is essential to understanding human history. Language is interlinked with cultural identity, learning about the historical dynamics of language \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{diversification }\DIFaddend informs our understanding of our story generally. The question of language splitting in particular is interesting as it also implies community splitting. What causes us to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lose touch, to }\DIFdelend diverge and go \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{our }\DIFaddend separate ways? This research topic has received a lot of attention in recent years (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. }\DIFaddend \citet{gavin2017process,  greenhill2015demographic, Pacheco_Coelho_2019, hua2019ecological}). In this study, we will take a closer look specifically at the region of Remote Oceania \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and one particular hypothesis - that political organisation predicts the number of languages}\DIFaddend .

Fig.~\ref{RO_overnight_coloured_dots} shows the language richness of the islands of Oceania. Languages are points, coloured by language family. In the Polynesian islands (S\={a}moa, Tonga, Rarotonga, Tokelau etc), there is generally one language per island group. However, in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{central west Remote Oceania }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the rest of the region there are many more languages per island group }\DIFaddend (Vanuatu, Temotu, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Chuuk, }\DIFaddend Fiji and Kanaky) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{there are many more languages }\DIFdelend --- sometimes up to 20 languages on the very same island. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The archipelagos of Chuuk, Wa'ab and Pohnpei also feature more languages than the Polynesian islands and atolls. }\DIFdelend What explains this difference?
%What are the mechanics of this?

\label{RO_overnight_coloured_dots}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

Let us first consider some plausible factors in language diversification. Firstly, diversification takes time. We would expect a higher probability of language diversification in areas where people have lived for a longer time \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simply }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{minimally }\DIFaddend due to natural drift as communities spread out and form separate clusters. All of Remote Oceania was settled in approximately the last 3,500 years but at different stages. A large part of Remote Oceania was settled for the first time by Austronesian-speaking people in a rapid expansion 3,600 - 2,800 BP known as the ``Lapita expansion'' (\citet[106-7]{bellwood2006austronesians}; \citet[137]{rieth_cochrane_2018}). This first area covers all islands of Vanuatu, Temotu, New Caledonia, Fiji and parts of Western Polynesia. The dates of the first settlement for these islands are relatively similar, but there still is a large discrepancy in the number of languages (see Fig \ref{RO_overnight_coloured_dots}). This makes for a convenient case for comparison. If we include other regions of Oceania, such as Australia or the New Guinea region \citep{ross2017_new_guinea_region}, the comparison becomes more complex as they have been settled for a much much longer time-span --- possibly up to 60,000 years. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Here we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore, there may be other unknowns that are relevant for Near Oceania that we have not found yet. In this study, we }\DIFaddend focus specifically on Remote Oceania \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in order to test specific theories about the diversification there that have been presented by anthropologists and linguists}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{because of the similarity of time-depth which allows for a more fair comparison}\DIFaddend .

Let us compare two island groups in this region as an example: the S\={a}moan archipelago in Western Polynesia and the island of Malakula in Vanuatu. There is one indigenous language spoken in S\={a}moa ---  S\={a}moan --- and in Malakula there are 33 distinct languages spoken \citep{glottolog3}. S\={a}moa was settled approximately 400 years after Malakula \citep[137-8]{rieth_cochrane_2018}. This gives Malakula a bit of a ``head-start'', but most likely not enough to explain the vast difference.

Besides time depth, we might also expect that more space entails greater language diversity. A larger area makes it possible \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to spread out communities , which can entail language splitting}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for communities to become geographically isolated from each other}\DIFaddend . However, the shoreline\footnote{Since Austronesian settlements are mainly found on the coast, we are comparing shorelines instead of land area.} of Malakula is 67\% of that of S\={a}moa. S\={a}moa is larger than Malakula \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{--- so clearly size of island is not enough}\DIFaddend . What other factors are there that can aid our understanding here?

\citet{turner1884} and \citet{pawley81,pawley2007} have suggested that the discrepancy between the number of languages in different parts of Remote Oceania can be related to societal structure. Societies in Vanuatu and New Caledonia tend to be less hierarchical than societies in Polynesia. Societies with fewer vertical levels of political structure are associated with more linguistic and cultural diversity. Conversely, more hierarchically complex societies are associated with linguistic and cultural homogeneity \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{--- even over larger areas. S\={a}moa for example is a society that for large part of its history has had several levels of political authority, but this does not appear to be the case for Malakula.
}\DIFaddend 

%DIF < A measurement of so-called ``political complexity'' in ethnographic surveys (c.f. \citet{gray1998ethnographic}) should then be correlated with different patterns of interaction and show up as a significant factor in language diversification. This is true even if political complexity is merely a proxy measurement of the interaction pattern that is in fact driving language change. 
%DIF > A measurement of so-called ``political complexity'' in ethnographic surveys (cf. \citet{gray1998ethnographic}) should then be correlated with different patterns of interaction and show up as a significant factor in language diversification. This is true even if political complexity is merely a proxy measurement of the interaction pattern that is in fact driving language change. 

This study tests the hypothesis that more vertical levels of political organisation are meaningfully connected to the number of languages, also when we incorporate other possible factors like settlement time, size and ecological environment (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. }\DIFaddend \citet{NETTLE1998}, \citet{gavin2012island} and \citet{hua2019ecological}). If the results show that political complexity has a significant correlation with the number of languages per island group when other relevant factors are controlled for, this lends support to Turner and Pawley's hypothesis.

%We will be using cultural data on societal structures in societies of Remote Oceania, archaeological dates and environmental variables (temperature and rainfall) to test if the political structure still significantly predicts the number of languages once other factors have been taken into account. Fig.~\ref{RO_overnight_coloured_dots} shows languages in Oceania, with islands grouped by overnight sailing distances \citep{mark_1986, marck2000}. In this study, we are concerned with languages of Remote Oceania (see Fig.~\ref{Remote_Oceania_subregions} for subregions of Oceania), and in particular Vanuatu and New Caledonia compared to the rest.

%First, we will go through previous research, secondly, we will have an overview of the region given the variables we are using in the study. Thirdly, the method will be presented and lastly we will go through the results and possible interpretations of them.

\section{Previous research}
\label{sec:previous_research}
Linguists, anthropologists and scholars of other fields have long remarked on the link between linguistic diversity and political structure in Remote Oceania. One of the oldest examples of this observation is the European Turner who travelled in the region 1861-1884 and hypothesized that the lack of regional variation \emph{within} S\={a}moan entailed that they had \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{long }\DIFdelend had a centralized government \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for a long time }\DIFaddend \citep[172]{turner1884}. Linguists have linked types of societal organization to different diversification processes. Language change is embedded in social structure (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. }\DIFaddend \citep{WLH1968}), or as \citet[124]{grace_1992_aberrant} writes: ``linguistic similarities and differences [are] reflections of community structures''. As \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{community }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{social }\DIFaddend ties weaken and what was once one \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{social network splitsin twain}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{community splits}\DIFaddend , we expect that this is reflected in language variation as well. In this way, language studies provide insights to neighbouring fields such as archaeology, anthropology etc.

\citet{pawley81, pawley2007} discusses the specific hypothesis that while much of Remote Oceania was settled in similar ways by Austronesian-speaking people, and at comparable time depths, and developed similarly immediately after the first settlement, the differences between them stem from the rise of powerful chiefs and maintenance of long-distance voyaging in the island groups of Polynesia. This theory suggests that the steps of the diversification process were more or less the same, but that the \emph{rate} by which it progressed differed and that this is the cause for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discrepancy of number of languages per island group that }\DIFaddend we see today.\footnote{\citet{lynch1981melanesian} calls this ``the diversification cycle theory''.} 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The societal structure in Polynesia was such that the process of cultural diversification was slower than in Vanuatu and New Caledonia.

\DIFaddend %This diversification process has two stages. First, there are similar sequences of rapid expansion over the entire island group, and sparse settlement with trade and marriages between different sister communities. Second, there is denser settlement associated with localised trade and marriage practices between sister communities, more intensive agriculture and weakening of kin ties and linguistic divergence.

The connection between the rise of powerful chiefs and language richness is not direct, but mediated through a number of other factors.

\DIFdel{It is possible that individual leaders in more stratified societies do not have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{be a predictor of the number of languages, it is unlikely that this is directly due to individual powerful leaders having }\DIFaddend a direct effect on the nature of the language of the community by means of their personality, conscious policies or directives.

}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(cf. \citet{watts_2018}) and that this, possible together with the mechanisms proposed by \citet{pawley2007}, has effects on language diversification. However, there are no resources available that describe the social network structure of ancient Oceanic societies, or the other factors that Pawley proposes --- but there is data on political complexity. 
}\DIFaddend 

In a similar vein to Pawley, \citet{curriemace2009} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{suggests }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{show }\DIFaddend that more stratified societies are correlated with larger language areas in Africa and Eurasia. If one language covers a large area, then the number of languages per square \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{kilometre }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{kilometer }\DIFaddend is lower than otherwise --- the language \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{density }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{richness }\DIFaddend is lower. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Their research can be interpreted to mean that more stratified societal structures are more capable of sustaining linguistic homogeneity over a larger geographical area(or possibly reducing diversity by cultural dominanceand warfare). Greater maintenance of cultural homogeneity would result in less language splitting over larger areas, and therefore a larger language area correlates with greater stratification. The approach }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\citet{curriemace2009} argue that one of the reasons behind their results (higher political complexity = larger language areas) is that societies with higher political complexity are more likely to be able to replace existing groups in an area, or otherwise incorporate (and possibly assimilate) them, for example by warfare or economical dominance. This effect may have increased in recent times due to Western colonization and globalization, but is also present in ancient history. For Remote Oceania specifically, there is evidence to suggest this is the case. For example, the island of Niuafo'ou which lies between Tonga, 'Uvea and S\={a}moa is home to a language that is most closely related to 'Uvean. This language has however become \emph{more} similar to Tongan during the period of Tongan domination in the area 1000-1300's (see \citet{aswani1998tongan} and \citep[2-9]{tuskamoto_niuafoou}). It may be that politically complex societies do not only \emph{maintain} homogeneity by continuing to be in contact after first settlement, but can also reduce diversity which emerges after settlement through incorporation and cultural dominance later. The approach of \citet{curriemace2009} }\DIFaddend is different from \citet{pawley81, pawley2007}, but the scientific line of argumentation is similar.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Returning to language richness in Remote Oceania, a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another }\DIFaddend significant factor to consider \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in Oceania }\DIFaddend besides those already discussed is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contact }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact-induced change }\DIFaddend --- in particular \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contact }\DIFaddend with people from the New Guinea region (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. }\DIFaddend \citet{ross2017_new_guinea_region}). Prior to European colonisation, all indigenous communities of Remote Oceania spoke \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend languages of the Austronesian family (see Fig \ref{RO_overnight_coloured_dots}). This family has its ultimate origins in Taiwan, and spread into the Remote Oceania approximately 3-4,000 years ago (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. }\DIFaddend Fig. \ref{austro_expansion_bellwood}). The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{peopling of New Guinea, the Bismarck archipelago and much of the Solomon Islands however is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{original peopling of Near Oceania (New Guinea Region and Solomons, excluding Temotu) however is much }\DIFaddend older than that \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(35,000 - 60}\DIFaddend ,\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and there is a great amount of language and cultural diversity there that may have influenced Austronesian people during and/or after their journeys east. }%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{000 years). That means that there was likely contact between Austronesian speaking people in Near Oceania prior to settlement of Remote Oceania. }\DIFaddend Recent studies of ancient and modern DNA \citep{lipson_harvad_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018, posth_jena_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018} have shown that there is evidence of significant levels of genes that are associated with origins in non-Austronesian speaking communities from New Guinea and Solomons among Vanuatu people. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The suggestion is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This indicates }\DIFaddend that while the initial settlement of Remote Oceania was likely to be wholly Austronesian (i.e. genetically similar to East Asian populations), there have since been more people \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{coming }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{arriving to the region }\DIFaddend who have deeper ancestry from the New Guinea region. Interestingly, \citet{posth_jena_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018} highlight that this had little effect on the languages of the region, communities in Vanuatu still speak languages that are clearly Austronesian in origin. This could be because the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{New Guinea }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Near Oceania }\DIFaddend people already spoke Austronesian languages at the point of migration\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, that they switched after arriving }\DIFaddend or due to other reasons (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. }\DIFaddend \citet[288, 321]{barlow2023papuan}; \citet[209-210]{bedford2018ancient}).

\end{figure}

\DIFadd{Further }\DIFaddend studies such as \citet{liu2022ancient} show similar genetic influence from New Guinea and Solomons northwards in Palau, Chuuk and Pohnpei island groups. It is becoming increasingly clear in the overall scientific literature on the ancient history of Oceania that there were a lot more connections and interactions than previously \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{postulated --- including to island groups }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{thought between non-Austronesian people }\DIFaddend of Near Oceania \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. It is not the case that people travelled to one place, and then stayed put there with little influence from other people of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and people of Remote Oceania. All of }\DIFaddend Oceania \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Oceania }\DIFdelend is an interconnected place today, and it was historically \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{too. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as well (cf. \citet{hauofa_1993}).
}\DIFaddend 

It is possible that these interactions, which were more frequent in Vanuatu than in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Polynesia}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{islands further east}\DIFaddend , have implications for many domains of human life --- including political organisation and language diversity. Linguist and anthropologist \citet[104]{lynch1981melanesian} has stressed the relevance of contact with non-Austronesian communities from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{New Guinea, Bismarck, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Near Oceania }\DIFaddend as a key factor in explaining why there are more languages in Vanuatu compared to the rest of Oceania \footnote{\citet{lynch1981melanesian} uses the terms ``Papuan'' and contrasts \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{islands of }\DIFaddend Melanesia and Polynesia. I have chosen to summarise him here \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{using }\DIFaddend more precise \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{terms in relation to how his work impacts the current study}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and modern descriptive terminology (non-Austronesian people of Near Oceania)}\DIFaddend . He writes specifically about the influence of languages of New Britain, Bougainville, central Solomon Islands, Manus and the southeast of New Guinea mainland (Oro province, Milne Bay province and National Capital District) on Oceanic languages of those regions and in Temotu.}. Lynch does not offer a precise account but outlines several different potential scenarios whereby contact with non-Austronesian groups caused greater diversification among Oceanic languages.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to incorporate data on contact with non-Austronesian speakers explicitly in the models of this study. This is primarily due to lack of information on this variable in island groups such as Kanaky (New Caledonia), Ratak \& Ralik (Marshall Islands), Marquesas, Aotearoa and other island groups. However, this factor is very important and we will return to it in the discussions.

%could have impacted the differences in language diversification rates that we see in the region. However, unfortunately, there is not enough data for this to be included as a factor in the analysis of this study but it may be approximated by proxy-variables such as time depth of settlement


%\emph{\textcolor{red}{(Note to Andy, Simon, Mark and Nick: it is possible to include Papuan contact as a rather granular variable in the analysis. I have tried running a variable that just classifies each island group as "Melanesian" or "Not Melanesian" for example. That variable did not come out as significantly predicting the language diversity. It also felt a bit too crude. I talked to Beth about it and she recommended me to leave it out. However, if you would like I can keep it in and give caveats. I don't know yet of any DNA study that I can use for this. Both Posth et al and Lipson et al don't sample New Caledonia or Fiji at all, which makes it tricky to use here.)}}

%\footnote{Note that this is separate from theories of effects of culture and environment on the \emph{nature} of language, such as the work by \citet{wraygrace2007}, \citet{lupyandale2010} and \citet{raviv2019compositional}. Their work focusses on why different kinds of interactional patterns has consequences for the compositionality/complexity of a language. For this study, we are concentrating on linguistic \emph{diversity} as opposed to \emph{disparity}.}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, there has }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There has also }\DIFaddend been a growing interest in environmental effects on language diversification\footnote{For a longer summary of recent studies of language diversification, see \citet{gavin2013toward} and \citet{greenhill2015demographic}.}. One of the oldest and most influential bodies of work in this vein is by Nettle. \citet{NETTLE1998} showed that there is a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correlation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relationship }\DIFaddend between number of languages per country and ecological risk (as measured by mean growing season). Nettle suggests that high-risk environments encourage wider social networks and therefore reduce the number of languages in that area. \citet{hua2019ecological} expanded on this idea and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{explains }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{explained }\DIFaddend that ``Smaller social groups are presumed to be more likely to be stable and self-sufficient in areas with a more abundant and reliable year-round food supply.'' \citet{hua2019ecological} constructed a more complex and fine-grained model of how environmental factors influence language diversity. They found that factors associated with risk (precipitation and temperature seasonality and season length) did indeed predict much of the distribution of languages in the world. Similarly, \citet{gavin2017process} showed that a simple model that takes into account rainfall and an upper bound of population size can to a large extent predict the distribution of indigenous languages in Australia. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Given the success of these models, the amount and seasonality of rainfall and temperature variables are also included in our model predicting language diversity in Remote Oceania. 
}\DIFdelend 

%There are many more papers on demographic, cultural and environmental factors on language diversification, unfortunately there is not space enough here to relate them all. There are two overview papers that summarises many other studies on the topic very well --- \citet{gavin2013toward} and \citet{greenhill2015demographic}. I will refrain from copying their clear and instructive summaries and meta-analysis and instead direct the curious reader to seek those two papers out themselves should they want to explore the topic further.

In their study of global environmental predictors of language diversification, \citet{hua2019ecological} noted that there were certain areas that remained unexplained (New Guinea, Himalayas, West Africa and Mesoamerica). This may be an indication that the model needs to be adjusted to account for more variables or that the variables do not have the same effect globally. A recent study of language diversification in North America \citep{Pacheco_Coelho_2019} showed that the best predictors of language change may vary from place to place and that the factors are interlinked causally in a complex manner. Their study included environmental variables and data on the population. The authors note that political complexity might be an important variable too, but they were, unfortunately, unable to include it \citep[7]{Pacheco_Coelho_2019}.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\citet[4-5]{gavin2012island} also found that the isolation of islands was a significant variable in their models for predicting language diversity on Oceania (including Near Oceania), alongside settlement time depth. 
}

\DIFadd{\citet{bromham_polynesian_sizes} show that population size can have an effect on the loss and gain of new words in Polynesian languages, which in turn could have consequences for language splitting. This effect is, however, later found to be weak or non-existent in wider samples \citet{greenhill2018population}. \citet{watts_2018} also find an effect of population size on religious conversion rates in Oceania. These studies indicate that there may be an effect of population size on cultural changes in Oceanic societies.
}

\DIFadd{Finally, there may be other relevant cultural factors at play than what has been discussed so far. Communities are not independent of each other, they interact can interact with each other through trade and other relationships, and they can be related by shared inheritance. There may be traits transmitted in this way that have consequences for language diversification. It is therefore important to take into account the spatial and phylogenetic non-independence of data points (cf. \citet{roberts2015future} \citet{gavin2013toward}). The exact identity of these traits are hard to decipher, it is possible that they is related to political complexity. This is an instance of controlling for a known unknown.
}

\DIFaddend This study focuses on a particular hypothesis concerning a particular region of the world \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{- Remote Oceania}\DIFaddend . It is possible that these models perform less well globally and the results should primarily be compared against the specific theories of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\citet{lynch1981melanesian} and }\DIFdelend \citet{pawley81, pawley2007} about Remote Oceania. As one of the few studies to include data on both environmental and socio-cultural variables, it is able to contribute a valuable perspective to the field of language diversity mechanics.

Several of the predictors are included both as interactions with other predictors and as sole predictors.

\label{pol_complex_method}
The approach of this paper is to gather relevant data on island groups and their societies and then fit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a statistical model which aims }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{statistical models which aim }\DIFaddend to predict the number of languages given all the variables. From the composition of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variables }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{predictors }\DIFaddend in the resulting model we can infer which have the greatest predicting power when they are co-estimated.

The unit of analysis is ``island group''. We cannot use modern political boundaries (``French Polynesia'', ``Cook Islands'' etc) because they are often historically and culturally inappropriate. As we want to capture something about the communities at large we are not satisfied with using individual islands. For these reasons, we use two different ways of grouping islands \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that represent the possible maximum extent of local communities}\DIFaddend : overnight sailing distances and shared language (see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{appendix \ref{sec:island_geo} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Appendix \ref{appendix_sec:island_geo} }\DIFaddend for details).

\DIFdelend A simple test of Spearman's Rank Order correlation reveals that the number of languages and political complexity per island group are indeed moderately correlated (rho  = -0.4, \emph{p} value < 0.001 for islands grouped for shared language). However, this is not sufficient. We want to investigate whether this correlation still holds once we explicitly incorporate other variables that we expect might explain language diversity as well, such as time-depth and environmental factors. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In addition, we also include controls for phylogenetic and spatial non-independence in order to account for unobserved confounds that may be transferred through contact or inherited and affect the number of languages (cf. \citet{gavin2013toward}).

\DIFdelend The variables Net Primary Production (NPP; the amount of biomass or carbon produced), temperature \& rainfall (mean and seasonality) and absolute latitude are all associated with the suitability of a place for life and they correlate with each other, at least to some degree (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{c. f. Figs \ref{SPLOM_medium_all_variables} and \ref{SPLOM_SBZR_all_variables}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cf. Figs \ref{appendix_SPLOM_medium_all_variables} and \ref{appendix_SPLOM_SBZR_all_variables}}\DIFaddend ). In this study, they are all tracking a similar concept: the suitability for human populations to thrive in smaller groups. Because of this, we are running a Principal Components Analysis on all \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seven variables , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{variables related to this concept (NPP, temperature, rainfall and absolute latitude), }\DIFaddend this allows us to extract a variable that explains most of the information. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The aggregation is carried out twice, once for values of islands grouped by overnight-sailing distances and one for groups based on shared language. }\DIFaddend We ran a Non-Graphical Cattel's Scree Test \citep{cattell1966scree, R-nFactors} to determine the number of optimal components (overnight sailing distance island groups = 2 PCs, shared language island groups = 3 PCs). For more details, see Appendix \ref{appendix_environ}.

In order to create a formula for the statistical model, we consider the suggested causal relationships based on previous research (see section \ref{sec:previous_research}). Besides the effect of the environmental variables on language richness, we also hypothesise that there can be a joint effect with the size of the island.

%DIF < Most of the island groups in this dataset have only one language, and this seems to have caused some issues (despite the Negative Binomial distribution). The model does best at predicting languages in Polynesia (which is dominated by island groups with only one language). Islands groups in Polynesia can have a very long coastline (like the Paumotu archipelago of French Polynesia) or very short one (like Niue). There is not as much difference in shorelines between islands of Vanuatu. The model seems to have struggled with using shoreline to predict languages globally, even leading to the result that Shoreline as a standalone term comes out in the model as negatively predicting the number of languages (though not with a \emph{p} value that passes traditional thresholds of significance).

However, in the full sample there are island groups with much longer shorelines and only one language (Aotearoa and Paumotu). The estimates of the model show that while the interaction of Shoreline and Settlement order has a significant positive influence as an interaction, the effect is not large.

\DIFdel{When the island group Vanuatu + Temotu was dropped, the model for overnight sailing island groups no longer drew on political complexity as a relevant predictor of language richness. This may indicate that it primarily made use of the variable to tell apart Vanuatu + Temotu from all other island groups. Vanuatu + Temotu is by far the island group with the most languages, 130, and it is dominated by societies that are classed as level 1 on the scale of vertical political complexity used by the Ethnographic Atlas \citep{gray1998ethnographic} and other studies \citep{watts_2018}, see Fig. \ref{pol_complex_map} in appendix \ref{appendix_pol_complex}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{appendix_dates_map} such that high numbers represent further back in time, making the interpretation of effects more intuitive. Shoreline was log-10-transformed to reduce the effect of extreme outliers such as the South Island of Aotearoa (cf. \citet{rolett2004environmental} and \citet{atkinson2016cultural}). For EA033 (political complexity}\DIFaddend )\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, the mode of each island group was used}\footnote{\DIFadd{In instances of ties, the value for the island group was randomly selected.}}\DIFadd{. Spatial and phylogenetic relatedness is Incorporated into the model as relationship between data points rather than features of data-points (see Appendix \ref{appendix_sp_control}). All predicting variables (save spatial and phylogenetic relatedness) were then normalized in the conventional manner by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (centering and scaling). EA033 and settlement waves were both modelled as monotonic effects (i.e. it is not assumed that the difference between level 1 and 2 is the same length as the difference between 2 and 3, but they are still on an ordinal scale)}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, if we tease apart the argument concerning political complexity (for example in the full DAG in Fig. \ref{Predicting_lgs_DAG_full} in appendix \ref{appendix_DAG_def} or Fig. \ref{Predicting_lgs_DAG_andy} in section \ref{sec:previous_research}), we find that conceptually the link between the number of languages and political complexity is not direct. It could be mediated through other factors such as network modularity, the propensity to maintain long-distance contact etc.

\DIFdel{\citet{watts_2018} found that politically complex societies in Oceania became Christian at a faster speed. This may indicate that changes propagate through a population quicker if the society is not egalitarian. If Christianity spreads faster in societies with higher complexity, it is possible to reason that other changes also might spread faster. If changes propagate quickly throughout a population, that leaves less possibility for diversification through natural drift or groups in the periphery staying more archaic compared to the centre. This interpretation relies on the understanding that the variable for political complexity (EA033) reveals something not only about jurisdictional power relationships in a given society, but also captures something about the social network of \emph{all} of its members (not just the leaders). Under this theory, people living in societies with higher political complexity would be able to travel further and have wider-ranging social networks, which in turn would lead to greater internal cultural homogeneity.
}%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{Maintaining long-distance contact can indeed be a function of shared cultural identity. \citet[218-291]{skirgaard2020multilevel} notes that there are not only fewer languages in the island groups of Polynesia, but they are also more similar }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For each kind of grouping of islands (shared language and overnight sailing) four models were run (no control for spatial or phylogenetic non-independence, spatial control, phylogenetic control and control for both spatial and phylogenetic non-independence).

This relationship does not hold for grammatical features however, languages in Polynesia are similarly different from each other grammatically as languages of Vanuatu and other island groups in Remote Oceania are (as measured by Grambank features, \citep{grambank_release}). It has been suggested, by \citet{silverstein1981limits}, \citet{francois2011} and others (c.f. \citet{mansfield2023dialect}), that communities pay special attention to words and sound differences as emblematic of shared ties --- but grammar tends to fly under the radar in this respect. This difference between Vanuatu and Polynesia in terms of lexical dissimilarity and language richness, but the similarity in terms of grammatical diversification may indicate that the cause does indeed lie in attitudes and social network organisation rather than merely time and environmental factors.

}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\citet{curriemace2009} argue that the reason behind their results (higher political complexity = larger language areas) is that societies with higher political complexity are more likely to be able to replace existing groups in an area, or otherwise incorporate (and possibly assimilate) them. It may also be the case that diversity in Polynesia was reduced by later expansionist efforts by societies with higher political complexity. For example, the island of Niuafo'ou which lies between Tonga, 'Uvea and S\={a}moa is home to a language that is most closely related to 'Uvean. This language has however become \emph{more} similar to Tongan during the period of Tongan domination in the area 1000-1300's (see \citet{aswani1998tongan} and \citep[2-9]{tuskamoto_niuafoou}). It may be that politically complex societies do not only \emph{maintain} homogeneity by continuing to be in contact after first settlement, but can also reduce diversity which emerges after settlement through incorporation and cultural dominance later.

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Whatever the political complexity variable is tracking, it is clear that it is one of the variables that most clearly picks out Vanuatu and that Vanuatu is the place with the most languages. Where did this difference in societal organisation come from? As previous studies have indicated (e.g. \citet{lynch1981melanesian}), the answer may lie in contact with people of non-East Asian origin further west. It is possible that contact with communities from New Guinea and Solomons (in Bismarck before migration to Vanuatu or in Vanuatu after initial settlement) brought with it societal changes to Vanuatu that caused it to be a different place from islands further east (c.f. Pawley's idea of the same process at different speeds). Besides the possible cultural influence on attitudes and societal organisation,
they may also have brought with them their own cultural heritage which would add to the diversity in itself.

%DIF < Both models include political complexity as a statistically significant factor for predicting language diversity in Remote Oceania which gives support to the hypothesis tested in this study. As expected, space and time also came out as significant factors. This indicates that the longer time people lived in a place and the longer shoreline/more land there was, the more languages arise. This is in line with previous research. \citet{curriemace2009} found that politically complex societies (``ethnolinguistic groups'') cover a larger geographical area than societies with low political complexity.  Assuming one language per society\footnote{By using language area as a measurement of the size of ethnolinguistic groups/societies, \citet{curriemace2009} make this assumption.}, a random 10 km$^2$ sample which has a high average value for political complexity (averaging over all language polygons that are found in the cell) will then have fewer languages. For example, the language Turkish is associated with a political complexity score of four \citep{d_place_all} and covers a large area whereas the many languages of the nearby Caucasus are generally coded as low political complexity and cover smaller areas \citep{ethnologue2005}. If we take a 10 km$^2$ sample in Anatolia (where Turkish is spoken) we find fewer languages and higher complexity on average than if we sample the same sized area in the Caucasus. Similarly, we find fewer languages per island group in Remote Oceania the higher the average political complexity.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A counterexample to this trend globally is the presence of large areas covered by language societies with low political complexity and majority pastoralist subsistence strategies. \citet{curriemace2009} found such cases, but their results concluded that the best predictor for the overall global patterns in their data was still political complexity. Another possible counterexample might be regions of many societies with high complexity where each society covers a small area in close proximity to each other. This is arguably the case for historic city states in Ancient Greece as these covered fairly small areas and had many political levels (see \citet{cartwright_2013}, and \citet[19]{sealey1976history}). However, the city states of Ancient Greece are usually all described as speaking different dialects of the same language, not different languages. This means that the language area of Ancient Greek (which is what \citet{curriemace2009} measured) would still be large and the average political complexity high, which would support their hypothesis.

%DIF < It is beyond the scope of this study to fully investigate the causality of language diversification in Remote Oceania. Causality in cultural evolution is very complicated, since factors can interact on many levels and it is difficult to control for unknown variables and proxy effects (c.f \citet{roberts2013linguistic}). In this instance, we will be satisfied with testing if there is a correlation between societal structure and language diversity that is still signifncant once environmental and settlement time has been incorporated into the model.

\DIFdel{Similarly to \citet{gavin2012island}, \citet{hua2019ecological} and others, the results of this study indicate that environmental factors, as encapsulated by the principal components, play some in explaining language diversity in Remote Oceania.

}%DIFDELCMD <

%DIF < This is most likely because most of the island groups share a similar climate, and there is therefore not enough variation to tease them apart.

%DIF < As can be seen from the specific predictions the models make (Fig. \ref{medium_model_predict} and Fig. \ref{SBZR_model_predict}), neither model accurately predicts the key island groups in our dataset (Vanuatu, Kanaky (New Caledonia) and Temotu). Explaining the difference between Melanesian Remote Oceania and the rest is the most important factor in evaluating our hypothesis. Therefore the results should be interpreted as ultimately inconclusive.

%DIF < \citet{Pacheco_Coelho_2019} explore an approach where the predictive power of each variable is not fixed, but changes with respect to location. Such an approach may give more insight into this dataset, and is left as future work.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Possible limitations with this study are: a) the way that islands groups are defined, b) the manner in which the over-dispersion was accounted for and c) poor measurements of, or missing, key variables. Concerning (a), it may be that a grid-approach (c.f \citet{hua2019ecological}) is more appropriate. One of the problems with a grid approach is that it may work less well in an oceanic environment where connections between islands are not accounted for appropriately, but it should be tested in a similar manner to this study to evaluate if this indeed is a problem. A more finer grained approach similar to  \citet{gavin2012island} where each landmass is the unit of analysis may also be interesting. Both of these approaches may also aid with (b). There are other ways of accounting for (b), over-dispersion in data, besides a Negative Binomial distribution. For example, \citet[4-5]{gavin2012island} used the reciprocal of the language count. Regarding (c), \citet[4-5]{gavin2012island} found that Isolation was a significant variable in their models for predicting language diversity on Oceania (including Near Oceania). It is possible that the manner in which isolation was calculated here was suboptimal and that one or several of the other measurements of Isolation is more appropriate (see section \ref{sec:island_geo}). It was also not possible to include measurements of non-Austronesian contact in this study due to poor data coverage despite the fact that it could be a relevant factor (c.f. \citet{lipson_harvad_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018, posth_jena_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018}).

\DIFdel{This study investigated the hypothesis that besides time depth and environmental factors (c.f. \citet{curriemace2009, gavin2012island, hua2019ecological} and \citet{Pacheco_Coelho_2019}), language richness in Remote Oceania is also significantly influenced by interaction patterns that can be measured by political complexity (c.f. \citet{pawley81, pawley2007}). The results lend support to this thesis, with some caveats.

%DIF < Future studies should use a grid and/or otherwise more fine grained approach to sampling, test different statistical methods that deal with over-dispersed data, and attempt to include better data on isolation, population and non-Austronesian contact. This study concentrated on the number of languages in a place, but it may also be revealing to include measurements of how different the languages are from each other, in lexicon and/or structure.

In the next study we will look into more detail the way that linguists have approached these two levels of variation, micro and macro.

\DIFdel{and was further elaborated on in \citet{green1991near}. This distinction is based on geology, flora and fauna. Near Oceania consists of chains of inter-visible large islands and archipelagos, whereas the islands and atolls of Remote Oceania are separated by much greater distances.

The lines in the maps of \citet{green1991near} and \citet{pawley2007locatingoceanic} appear not to include these in Remote Oceania. I have included them in part to complete the Polynesian subgroup of languages and the languages of the Micronesian archipelagos, but also because it appears that these were largely not inhabited prior to the Austronesian expansion into the rest of Remote Oceania (c.f. \citet[23]{kirch2012basline}) which suggests that they are sufficiently distant from the larger islands of Near Oceania to be counted as ``Remote''.

\DIFdel{This study investigates factors influencing language diversification. The most central part of our data is the number of languages per island group; this is the response variable of our models. It is notoriously difficult to distinguish dialects, languages and language groups and there exist many different competing standards for defining what a language is. Linguists and others have debated these issues for a long time. Given their importance and centrality to this research, this section will give an introduction to the language identification standards adopted in two of the most commonly used resources: SIL International's ISO 639-3 codes for language names (which is implemented in Ethnologue \citep{ethnologue22})and Glottolog's glottocodes \citet{glottolog3}. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{It should be noted that while different language identification standards do differ, their findings do not vary dramatically. For example, SIL's Ethnologue states that there are 7,111 living languages today, Glottolog reports that there are 6,989}\footnote{\DIFdel{This the number of languoids in glottolog classifies as ``language'' and not labelled as ``extinct''.}}%DIFAUXCMD
\addtocounter{footnote}{-1}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{. The difference between these two total counts is ``only'' 122 --- which is quite small considering how controversial language identification standards can be. This is in line with Nettle's observation that while linguists often disagree on how precisely to define a language, there is often considerable agreement in practice when it comes to categorising specific language varieties \citep[356]{NETTLE1998}.

\item Two related varieties are normally considered varieties of the same language if speakers of each variety have inherent understanding of the other variety at a functional level (that is, can understand based on knowledge of their own variety without needing to learn the other variety).
\item Where spoken intelligibility between varieties is marginal, the existence of a common literature or of a common ethnolinguistic identity with a central variety that both understand can be a strong indicator that they should nevertheless be considered varieties of the same language.
\item Where there is enough intelligibility between varieties to enable communication, the existence of long-standing distinctly named ethnolinguistic identities coupled with well-developed standardization and literature that are distinct can be treated as an indicator that they should nevertheless be considered to be different languages.

If references were not accurately tied to a language variety, this would be confusing as ``German'' would have different numbers of vowels in different sources. By providing stable identifiers for dialects as well as languages and providing a controlled hierarchy, it is possible for researchers to document their data accurately while still making it possible to aggregate up to the ``language-level'' when it is desirable. For example, Grambank and the Standard Cross Cultural Sample of D-PLACE both contain entries for specific languages and dialects. There are 158 one-to-one matches between the glottocodes of these two databases. In some cases though, the databases contain different dialects of the same language.

\DIFdel{The definitions of language in ISO 639-3 (as described in Ethnologue \citep{ethnologue2019lgident}) and Glottolog both focus on mutual intelligibility. Ethnologue notes that intelligibility does have to be symmetric, but neither of the resources discuss multilingualism, or multidialectalism in any detail. It is possible that the world used to be much more multilingual than it is today \citep{evans2017did}, and there are still many places where communities are highly competent in many different language varieties. Ethnologue state that they focus on \emph{inherent} intelligibility, as opposed to \emph{acquired}, but in situations where languages are not formally taught but rather present in the community continuously it can be difficult to draw the boundary between inherent and acquired. The underestimation of multilingualism has significant consequences for studies of the evolution of language \citep{roberts2013evolutionary}. However, unless two languages are exclusively spoken in a fully multilingual setting and never outside of it, the total count of languages should remain the same.

Vanuatu, being a land of great language diversity, has a different group for almost every island. Another example is the Tungaru islands (western islands of modern-day Kiribati) and Tuvalu which actually share a language.

\DIFdel{Finally, these island groups should be taken with a grain of salt. They are most likely better than using modern nation-states and they are more explicitly and principally defined than many other island groups in other studies which rely on conventional definitions of well-known island groups or consider each island separately. However, the task of finding definite meaningful social geographic units in Oceania prior to colonization is difficult. Most likely the parameters vary over the space, for example with access to different kinds of sailing technology or different customs. Furthermore, from the initial settlement of Remote Oceania approximately 3,000 years ago until Western colonisation, there must have been a large amount of variation. \citep{rolett2002voyaging} for example discusses the decline in inter-island group voyaging in East Polynesia after 1450 CE. That said, these two approaches offer two different ways of viewing Oceania as a socially interconnected space --- one more granular than the other --- and are the best available island groupings for historical research known to the author.

%DIF < For each of these island groups, absolute latitude, total area and shoreline were calculated from the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG), version 2.3.7 \citep{wessel1996global}. The analysis of this study also includes the ratio of shoreline to area, as we may expect islands groups with many small islands and atolls to be different from those with one large island, even if their overall area is the same\footnote{Thank you to the anonymous examiner who suggested including this.}. Area and shoreline were both log-transformed (log 10). This was done both to be in line with previous studies \citep{gavin2012island} and because the distributions had extreme outliers (New Caledonia and Aotearoa/New Zealand). Such outliers end up driving the model in a manner that is not representative of the overall sample. By logging these variables the overall structure and order of data-points remains the same but the influence of the extreme outliers is reduced.

For the island groups defined by shared language which are smaller than Marck groups, the water area was assigned proportionally to the islands landmass size in comparison to the entire Marck group's landmass (i.e. Malakula makes up)

%DIF < A score of isolation was also calculated based on the GSHHG-data as well. There are many different ways of measuring island isolation. \citet{rolett2004environmental} use two measures, distance from home island to island which is >25\% larger than home island and distance to island >75\% larger than home island. \citet{gavin2012island} use distance to the Asian continent (after considering three other measurements). The ``Isolation index'' of the Islands database \citep{dahl1991island}  is calculated as follows: (distance to nearest equivalent or larger island)$^{0.5}$ + (distance to nearest island group or archipelago)$^{0.5}$ + (distance to nearest continent)$^{0.5}$. \citet{weigelt_2013} present an overview and comparison of 17 different island isolation measurements used in biology and conclude that it is advisable to consider stepping-stone pathways, larger islands (besides continents), climatic similarity and the area of surrounding landmasses when studying the richness of species in relation to island isolation.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < In light of this, and given the data available, a simple isolation metric has been calculated. This measurement consists of \textit{the distance from the largest landmass of each island group to the closest landmass which is the largest in its island group}. This is essentially a distance of ``home island'' to closest other ``home island''. For example, for Hawai'i the largest island is the Big Island. The closest island to the Big Island which is also itself the largest in its group is part of the M\={a}ngarongaro atoll (also known as Penrhyn or Tongareva). This distance is 3,191 km. This is the largest distance for our isolation measurements, therefore Hawai'i is the most isolated island group. The metric is calculated separately for the overnight distance groups and shared language groups and was also logged (log 10) for the same reasons that area and shoreline was logged.

It has been suggested, by \citet{silverstein1981limits}, \citet{francois2011} and others (cf. \citet{mansfield2023dialect}), that communities pay special attention to words and sound differences as emblematic of shared ties --- but grammar tends to fly under the radar in this respect and is not as often recruited to mark social group membership. Future research into language diversification in Oceania should study the behaviour of different parts of language as they may exhibit different evolutionary dynamics (cf. \citet{greenhilletal_2017}).

\DIFdel{However, this framework is less easy to apply to the Melanesian islands of Remote Oceania where political structure often is described more in terms of autonomous and equal groups organised into horizontal structures such as exchange networks --- both within and between societies (c. f. \citet{bonnemaison1996graded} and \citet{huffman1996trading}). \citet{bolton1998chief} points out that the very concept of ``chief'' is new to Vanuatu, writing that chiefs were in many places first introduced by Europeans to fill the role of ``representative for a community towards outsiders'' and then transformed into ``representative for traditional culture (kastom)'' \citep[185]{bolton1998chief}. In this study, political complexity could also be a proxy measurement of social network cohesiveness (c.f. \citet{grace_1992_aberrant}). Differences between modern Vanuatu ``chiefs'' and pre-European political structures are therefore unlikely to be large enough to give rise to dramatically different scores in this metric.

In this case study, we are testing the hypothesis that societies that are rules by ``powerful chiefs'' and have more levels of vertical jurisdictional structures are slower at diversifying than societies with a more egalitarian/horizontal structure.

%DIF < Reading ethnographies is difficult, and involves a lot of interpretation and additional knowledge of context. It is not that dissimilar from reading grammars (which I have more experience with).

I had the fortune to be able to correspond with Sheehan and discuss particular cases in greater detail, which was very valuable. During these investigations, I also came across a typology of political systems in Vanuatu compiled by \citet{bonnemaison1996graded} (see Fig.~\ref{Bonnemaison_map}) which provided more data-points. In reading \citet{bonnemaison1996graded, sahlins63},  and discussing with Sheehan, I concluded that it is possible to infer a level of 1 for EA033 where Bonnemaison describes a society as having a ``grade-taking system''. It is however unclear if a coding of 2 or higher can be made when societies are described as ``chieftainship of ``Polynesian'' type, so I did not record those observations in our dataset. In the end, I arrived at a dataset that had good enough coverage for this study (130 out of 233 language-societies and 61/105 island groups) and that I felt confident represented the description of these societies well.

\DIFdelend %DIF > Both models include political complexity as a statistically significant factor for predicting language diversity in Remote Oceania which gives support to the hypothesis tested in this study. As expected, space and time also came out as significant factors. This indicates that the longer time people lived in a place and the longer shoreline/more land there was, the more languages arise. This is in line with previous research. \citet{curriemace2009} found that politically complex societies (``ethnolinguistic groups'') cover a larger geographical area than societies with low political complexity.  Assuming one language per society\footnote{By using language area as a measurement of the size of ethnolinguistic groups/societies, \citet{curriemace2009} make this assumption.}, a random 10 km$^2$ sample which has a high average value for political complexity (averaging over all language polygons that are found in the cell) will then have fewer languages. For example, the language Turkish is associated with a political complexity score of four \citep{d_place_all} and covers a large area whereas the many languages of the nearby Caucasus are generally coded as low political complexity and cover smaller areas \citep{ethnologue2005}. If we take a 10 km$^2$ sample in Anatolia (where Turkish is spoken) we find fewer languages and higher complexity on average than if we sample the same sized area in the Caucasus. Similarly, we find fewer languages per island group in Remote Oceania the higher the average political complexity.

\DIFdel{In order to test whether political complexity is driving language diversification in Remote Oceania, we need to control for other relevant variables --- in particular time depth of human settlement. The time of settlement indicates how long a community is likely to have been in a certain place. 
}\DIFdelend %DIF > A counterexample to this trend globally is the presence of large areas covered by language societies with low political complexity and majority pastoralist subsistence strategies. \citet{curriemace2009} found such cases, but their results concluded that the best predictor for the overall global patterns in their data was still political complexity. Another possible counterexample might be regions of many societies with high complexity where each society covers a small area in close proximity to each other. This is arguably the case for historic city states in Ancient Greece as these covered fairly small areas and had many political levels (see \citet{cartwright_2013}, and \citet[19]{sealey1976history}). However, the city states of Ancient Greece are usually all described as speaking different dialects of the same language, not different languages. This means that the language area of Ancient Greek (which is what \citet{curriemace2009} measured) would still be large and the average political complexity high, which would support their hypothesis.



\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For most islands in our dataset, there is at least one archaeological study indicating time of first settlement.

See appendix \ref{dates_table_appendix} for a table of dating data. }\DIFdelend %DIF > It is beyond the scope of this study to fully investigate the causality of language diversification in Remote Oceania. Causality in cultural evolution is very complicated, since factors can interact on many levels and it is difficult to control for unknown variables and proxy effects (c.f \citet{roberts2013linguistic}). In this instance, we will be satisfied with testing if there is a correlation between societal structure and language diversity that is still signifncant once environmental and settlement time has been incorporated into the model.



\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For most of the island groups, the labels provided in \citet{rieth_cochrane_2018} or the other sources neatly corresponded to the island groups in our data (e.g. Mangareva = Mangareva). However, sometimes the label refers to a larger area, this is the case of ``Austral Islands'' which in our data-set is broken down into Rimatara, Tupuai, Ra'ivavae and Rurutu respectively. In such cases it is assumed that the time can be generalised over the smaller island groups (this is also the case for the political complexity metric). Furthermore, some island groups have not been subject to archaeological research, but they are known to have been settled in association with another place that has been studied. For example, while there have been no archaeological excavations on the Sorol atoll of Micronesia, it is known to be closely related to Ulithi \citep[23]{quackenbush1968sonsorol} and it is likely that it was settled at a similar time. In such cases, the time depth is inferred based on information from nearby islands. For every island, the table in the appendix \ref{dates_table_appendix} lists the label of the island group in the source and whether the settlement timing has been inferred based on evidence from nearby islands or not.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > This is most likely because most of the island groups share a similar climate, and there is therefore not enough variation to tease them apart.

\DIFdel{. In order to make the dates from different sites directly comparable they need to be re-calibrated in the same way. It was not possible to access all the necessary information on each publication and re-calibrate the dates appropriately. Instead of using the raw dates from the different studies, the islands have been sorted into a settlement order with twelve waves based on the dates in the literature and descriptions of what was settled in the same wave.
Fig.~\ref{dates_map} illustrates the settlement wave order per island. Exact dates and references are found in appendix \ref{dates_table_appendix}.
}\DIFdelend %DIF > As can be seen from the specific predictions the models make (Fig. \ref{medium_model_predict} and Fig. \ref{SBZR_model_predict}), neither model accurately predicts the key island groups in our dataset (Vanuatu, Kanaky (New Caledonia) and Temotu).

Therefore the results should be interpreted as ultimately inconclusive.

Concerning (a), it may be that a grid-approach (c.f \citet{hua2019ecological}) is more appropriate. One of the problems with a grid approach is that it may work less well in an oceanic environment where connections between islands are not accounted for appropriately, but it should be tested in a similar manner to this study to evaluate if this indeed is a problem. A more finer grained approach similar to  \citet{gavin2012island} where each landmass is the unit of analysis may also be interesting. Both of these approaches may also aid with (b). There are other ways of accounting for (b), over-dispersion in data, besides a Negative Binomial distribution. For example, \citet[4-5]{gavin2012island} used the reciprocal of the language count. Regarding (c), \citet[4-5]{gavin2012island} found that Isolation was a significant variable in their models for predicting language diversity on Oceania (including Near Oceania). It is possible that the manner in which isolation was calculated here was suboptimal and that one or several of the other measurements of Isolation is more appropriate (see section \ref{appendix_sec:island_geo}). It was also not possible to include measurements of non-Austronesian contact in this study due to poor data coverage despite the fact that it could be a relevant factor (cf. \citet{lipson_harvad_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018, posth_jena_ancient_dna_vanuatu_2018}).

\DIFdel{To understand the vast majority of human history and diversification, we should consider the state of societies as they were before the introduction of Western colonisation, industrialisation, globalization etc as these have only been around in the last 500 years. Behaviourally modern humans emerged between 90,000 and 160,000 years ago (\citet{powell2009late}: \cite{marean2007early}). The last 500 years represent between 0.6\% and 0.3\% of our history. If we consider only the time period of more sedentary living and agriculture, i.e. approximately the last 11,000 years (c. f. \citet{kislev2006early}), the proportion of time since Columbus landing in the Caribbean is 4.5\%.
}%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{The aforementioned processes, while recent, have resulted in mass immigration/invasion (c.f. \citet{invasion_day}) to places like the Americas, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and oppressive policies that reduce language diversity. They have had a massive impact in the comparatively short time span that they have been active and are not only perpetuated by Western forces but also other powerful groups (see for example the case of Indonesian power in Western New Guinea \citep{gietzelt1989indonesianization}). Another driving force that is relatively recent and related is the emergence of modern nation-states and their ideologies (c. f. \citet{foucault2007security}, \citet[21-22]{oakes2001language}). In connection with the aforementioned forces, the formation of modern nation-states has further reduced diversity that was present within groups (through means like ideological movements (e.g.the \emph{Volkgeist}-movement), nationally standardized mass education, mass media, print-media etc). The creation of nation-states and their continued development is often tied to ideas of one sole homogeneous culture (c.f. \citet{encyclo_nationalism}), which results in the disappearance of regional variation, minority languages etc within what we today conceive of as ``countries''/``nation-states''}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Political complexity is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a complex variable. The variable did have a significant effect on language richness in some of the models, but not all}\DIFaddend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is possible that this is because political complexity is in fact a proxy-measurement of other relevant latent variables (as is illustrated by the DAGs of Fig. \ref{Predicting_lgs_DAG_andy} and Fig. \ref{Predicting_lgs_DAG_full}).
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The massive effect of these forces in the last 500 years means that for historical scientists, there isa big difference between considering the human landscape before and after this point --- especially in terms of cultural history and diversity. \citet[7340-7341]{curriemace2009} find that the data available for language territories in Australia and the Americas is so affected by colonial history and population replacement to make it impossible to include it in the analysis alongside the other regions.

\DIFdel{There is also a problem with information pertaining to history before these massive forces step onto the stage. Ethnographic accounts are often ``snapshots'' with unclear time-depth

\DIFdel{Directed Acyclic Graphs are a helpful tool in causal reasoning (\citet{pearl1995causal} and \citet{mcelreath2020statistical}). Fig. \ref{Predicting_lgs_DAG_full} shows a full DAG of all variables discussed in the literature that are related to this topic. Nodes with dashed outlines indicate that the variable cannot be instantiated in a measurable predictor for modelling, most often due to a lack of data. Variables that only relate to the response variable through measurable intermediate nodes (e.g. isolation) are excluded.
 }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Another environmental factor that has been used in previous studies is island isolation. How distant are the islands from each other, or from a large landmass? This is a common variable in studies of species richness  in biology. The theory is that the more isolated an island is, the harder it is to reach for plants and animals --- the lower the immigration rate and therefore lower biological diversity. It has been shown, among other results, that isolation can account for 85\%-90\% of variance of species richness in birds on islands \citep{kalmar2006global}. \citet{terrell1976island} suggested that isolation may also be helpful in explaining the distribution of languages over islands of Near Oceania. The more isolated an island is, the fewer people would reach it and this would lead to lower cultural diversity as well as biodiversity. In a recent study, \citet{gavin2012island} showed that isolation is indeed a relevant factor in explaining language diversity in Oceania at large. 
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < However, while isolation and other environmental factors significantly explained much of the distribution of languages in their study, it did not account for as much as in studies of biological species. In her description of S\={a}moa, \citet[287]{mead1937samoans} writes of an economy of plenty that still maintains cultural homogeneity over several islands. This would seem to contradict the ecological risk hypothesis. \citet{gavin2012island} conclude that human diversity may also be influenced by social, economic and political factors. This aligns well with the theories of Oceanic scholars. Results from this study may contribute to our understanding of these factors.

%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A. Why Bayesian. If the audience requires it, explain what benefits will be gleaned by a Bayesian analysis (as opposed to a frequentist analysis).
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < B. Goals of analysis. Explain the goals of the analysis. This prepares the audience for the type of models to expect and how the results will be described.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Step 1. Explain the model
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A. Data variables. Explain the dependent (predicted) variables and independent (predictor) variables.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < B. Likelihood function and parameters. For every model, explain the likelihood function and all the parameters, distinguishing clearly between parameters of primary theoretical interest and ancillary parameters. If the model is multilevel, be sure that the hierarchical structure is clearly explained, along with any covariance structure if multivariate parameter distributions are used.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < C. Prior distribution. For every model, explain and justify the prior distribution of the parameters in the model.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < D. Formal specification. Include a formal specification (mathematical or computer code) of the likelihood and prior, located either in the main text or in in publicly and persistently accessible online supplementary material.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < E. Prior predictive check. Especially when using informed priors but even with broad priors, it is valuable to report a prior predictive check to demonstrate that the prior really generates simulated data consistent with the assumed prior knowledge.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Step 2. Report details of the computation
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A. Software. Report the software used, including any specific added packages or plugins.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < B. MCMC chain convergence. Report evidence that the chains have converged, using a convergence statistic such as PSRF, for every parameter or derived value.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < C. MCMC chain resolution. Report evidence that the chains have high resolution, using the ESS, for every parameter or derived value.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < D. If not MCMC. If using some computational procedure other than MCMC, be aware of and report inherently inaccurate approximations, especially for the limits of credible intervals.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Step 3. Describe the posterior distribution
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A. Posterior predictive check. Provide a posterior predictive check to show that the model usefully mimics the data.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < B. Summarize posterior of variables. For continuous parameters, derived variables and predicted values, report the central tendency and limits of the credible interval. Explicitly state whether you are using density-based values (mode and HDI) or quantile-based values (median and ETI), and state the mass of the credible interval (for example, 95%).
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < C. BF and posterior model probabilities. If conducting model comparison or hypothesis testing, report the BF and posterior probabilities of models for a range of prior model probabilities.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Step 4. Report decisions (if any) and their criteria
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A. Why decisions? Explain why the decisions are theoretically meaningful and which decision procedure is being used. Regardless of which decision procedure is used, if it addresses null values, it should be able to accept the null value not only reject it.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < B. Loss function. If utilities and a loss function for a decision rule are defined, these should be explained and reported.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < C. ROPE limits. If using a continuous-parameter posterior distribution as the basis for decision, state and justify the limits of the ROPE and the required probability mass.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < D. BF, decision threshold and model probabilities. If using model comparison or hypothesis testing as the basis for a decision, state and justify the decision threshold for the posterior model probability, and the minimum prior model probability that would make the posterior model probability exceed the decision threshold.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < E. Estimated values too. If deciding about null values, always also report the estimate of the parameter value (central tendency and credible interval).
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < Step 5. Report sensitivity analysis
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < A. For broad priors. If the prior is intended to be vague or only mildly informed so that it has minimal influence on the posterior, show that other vague priors produce similar posterior results.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < B. For informed priors. If the prior is informed by previous research, show what posterior results from a vague prior or from a range of differently informed priors.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < C. For default priors. If using a default prior, show the effect of varying its settings. Be sure that the range of default priors constitutes theoretically meaningful priors, and consider whether they mimic plausible empirically informed priors.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < D. BFs and model probabilites. If the analysis involves model comparison or hypothesis testing, then for each prior report not only the BFs but also the posterior model probabilities for a range of prior model probabilities.
%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
%DIF < E. Decisions. If making decisions, report whether decisions change under different priors. For BFs, report changes in the minimum prior model probability needed to achieve decisive posterior model probability.
